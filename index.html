        Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency
        injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers
        to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop</p>

      <p>
        Good tools make application development quicker and easier to maintain than if you did everything by hand.</p>
      <p>The Angular CLI is a command line interface tool that can create a project, add files, and perform a variety of
        ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.</p>
      <p>
        The goal in this guide is to build and run a simple Angular application in TypeScript, using the Angular CLI while adhering
        to the Style Guide recommendations that benefit every Angular project.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of the chapter, you'll have a basic understanding of development with the CLI and a foundation for both these
        documentation samples and for real world applications.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 1. Set up the Development Environment </h3>
      <p>
        You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything. Install Node.js® and npm if they are not already
        on your machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then install the Angular CLI globally.
      </p>
      <code>
          npm install -g @angular/cli
      </code>
      <h3>Step 2. Create a new project</h3>
      <p>Open a terminal window</p>
      <p>
        Generate a new project and default app by running the following command:
      </p>
      <code>
          ng new app
      </code>
      <p>
        The Angular CLI installs the necessary npm packages, creates the project files, and populates the project with a simple default
        app. This can take some time.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Step 3: Serve the application
      </h3>
      <p>
        Go to the project directory and launch the server.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
          cd my-app
          ng serve --open
        </pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files. Using
        the --open (or just -o) option will automatically open your browser on http://localhost:4200/. Your app greets you
        with a message:
      </p>
      <h3>
        Step 4: Edit your first Angular component
      </h3>
      <p>
        The CLI created the first Angular component for you. This is the root component and it is named app-root. You can find it
        in <em>./src/app/app.component.ts</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open the component file and change the title property from 'app' to 'My First Angular App!'.
      </p>
      <code>
      <pre>
        export class AppComponent {
          title = 'My First Angular App!';
          }
      </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript.
        It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.</p>
      <p>
        The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components. NgModules
        collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at
        least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program
          logic and data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected
          into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular
        how to use them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with
          Angular directives and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.
        </li>
        <li>
          The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through dependency
          injection (DI).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the Router service to help you
        define navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.


      </p>
      <h3>Modules</h3>
      <p>
        Angular NgModules differ from and complement JavaScript (ES2015) modules. An NgModule declares a compilation context for
        a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities.
        An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form functional units.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Angular app has a root module, conventionally named AppModule, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches
        the application. An app typically contains many functional modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like JavaScript modules, NgModules can import functionality from other NgModules, and allow their own functionality to be
        exported and used by other NgModules. For example, to use the router service in your app, you import the Router NgModule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizing your code into distinct functional modules helps in managing development of complex applications, and in designing
        for reusability. In addition, this technique lets you take advantage of lazy-loading—that is, loading modules on
        demand—to minimize the amount of code that needs to be loaded at startup.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Components
      </h3>
      <p>
        Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component that connects a component hierarchy with the page
        document object model (DOM). Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated
        with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The @Component() decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a component, and provides the template and related
        component-specific metadata.
      </p>
      <h3>Templates, directives, and data binding </h3>
      <p>
        A template combines HTML with Angular markup that can modify HTML elements before they are displayed. Template directives
        provide program logic, and binding markup connects your application data and the DOM. There are two types of data
        binding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Event binding lets your app respond to user input in the target environment by updating your application data.</li>
        <li>Property binding lets you interpolate values that are computed from your application data into the HTML.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before a view is displayed, Angular evaluates the directives and resolves the binding syntax in the template to modify the
        HTML elements and the DOM, according to your program data and logic. Angular supports two-way data binding, meaning
        that changes in the DOM, such as user choices, are also reflected in your program data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your templates can use pipes to improve the user experience by transforming values for display. For example, use pipes to
        display dates and currency values that are appropriate for a user's locale. Angular provides predefined pipes for
        common transformations, and you can also define your own pipes.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="introduction_to_modules">
      <header>Introduction to modules</header>
      <p>
        Angular apps are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called NgModules. NgModules are containers for a cohesive
        block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. They can
        contain components, service providers, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing NgModule. They
        can import functionality that is exported from other NgModules, and export selected functionality for use by other
        NgModules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Angular app has at least one NgModule class, the root module, which is conventionally named AppModule and resides in
        a file named <em> app.module.ts</em>. You launch your app by bootstrapping the root NgModule.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a small application might have only one NgModule, most apps have many more feature modules. The root NgModule for an
        app is so named because it can include child NgModules in a hierarchy of any depth.
      </p>
      <h3>
        NgModule metadata
      </h3>
      <p>
        An NgModule is defined by a class decorated with @NgModule(). The @NgModule() decorator is a function that takes a single
        metadata object, whose properties describe the module. The most important properties are as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>declarations: The components, directives, and pipes that belong to this NgModule.</li>
        <li>exports: The subset of declarations that should be visible and usable in the component templates of other NgModules.</li>
        <li>imports: Other modules whose exported classes are needed by component templates declared in this NgModule.</li>
        <li>providers: Creators of services that this NgModule contributes to the global collection of services; they become
          accessible in all parts of the app. (You can also specify providers at the component level, which is often preferred.)</li>
        <li>bootstrap: The main application view, called the root component, which hosts all other app views. Only the root
          NgModule should set the bootstrap property.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here's a simple root NgModule definition.</p>
      <code>
        <pre>
  import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
  import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
  @NgModule({
    imports:      [ BrowserModule ],
    providers:    [ Logger ],
    declarations: [ AppComponent ],
    exports:      [ AppComponent ],
    bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
  })
  export class AppModule { }
        </pre>
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="introduction_to_components">
      <header>Introduction to components</header>
      <p>
        A component controls a patch of screen called a view. For example, individual components define and control each of the following
        views from the Tutorial:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The app root with the navigation links.
        </li>
        <li>
          The list of heroes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The hero editor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You define a component's application logic—what it does to support the view—inside a class. The class interacts with the
        view through an API of properties and methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, HeroListComponent has a heroes property that holds an array of heroes. Its selectHero() method sets a selectedHero
        property when the user clicks to choose a hero from that list. The component acquires the heroes from a service,
        which is a TypeScript parameter property on the constructor. The service is provided to the component through the
        dependency injection system.
      </p>
      <code>
        <pre>
            export class HeroListComponent implements OnInit {
              heroes: Hero[];
              selectedHero: Hero;
            
              constructor(private service: HeroService) { }
            
              ngOnInit() {
                this.heroes = this.service.getHeroes();
              }
            
              selectHero(hero: Hero) { this.selectedHero = hero; }
            }
        </pre>
      </code>
